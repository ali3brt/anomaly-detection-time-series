# Anomaly Detection and Predictive Modeling for Multivariate Time Series Data

This repository contains the implementation of advanced anomaly detection and predictive modeling techniques using multivariate time series data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning and deep learning models like Isolation Forest, LSTM, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, normalization, and memory optimization for large datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Comprehensive analysis of dataset features and relationships, including visualizations.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in time series data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employs LSTM neural networks and Gradient Boosting Classifier for accurate predictions.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Demonstrates real-time anomaly detection using sliding windows.
- **Scalable Codebase**: Structured for experimentation and scalability.
